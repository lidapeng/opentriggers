# About Wildfire Evacuation Trigger Modeler (WETM)
This project aims to build an opensource software system for setting wildfire evacuation triggers. The system is build using C++ and Qt. The opensource fire-spread modeling library fireLib is used for fire-spread modeling. 
# Tools:
C++, Qt, fireLib
# Project description:
The source code is located in the "wetm" folder, while the sample data are in "testdata1" and "smalldata" folders. 
# Work in Progress
We are currently working on the following aspects:
1) Adjust the fire spread rates and validate them using standard fire spread modeling tools (Behave plus)
2) Further improve the UI.
